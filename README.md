Live CV is a computer vision coding environment that displays results while you code. It can be used to interact, link and adjust algorithms 
in order to create quick solutions within it's domain. 

The application is built using QtQuick, and uses Open CV library in the back to do the actual processing, kind of like a QML wrapper for the 
Open CV library. 

An API is also available to link already built algorithms to Live CV's interface by simply exposing configurable variables to Qt's meta object system.

## Installation and getting started

To get started, simply download the application from Live CV's [website](http://livecv.dinusv.com/download.html), extract the archive, and you're ready 
to go. Step by step instructions are also found in the download section.
